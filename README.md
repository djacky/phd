Dr.(s) Karimi and Martino,
> This will be our repository to modify and share papers and notes for my PhD. 

# WARNING: Never modify the files in the master branch! First click the branch with your name and then modify the files you wish in that branch.

Paper's Folder:
* The files in the folder branch with your name can be modified by you. In the 'Papers' folder, you can modify the papers you wish. The papers with initial names "SUBMITTED" and "PUBLISHED" are those that already were submitted or published. The papers without these names are those that still have to be submitted. You can actually modify the .TEX files directly on your branch. Simply click on the .TEX paper you wish to modify, and you will then see the raw latex code that you can modify.
* If you need to add references to the papers, please let me know the papers you would like to add, and I can then update the master branch with this new reference.

Notes Folder:
* This is the folder where ideas (typically theoretical ideas) can be exchanged between us. Again, you should not modify the folder in the master branch.
