# WARNING: Never modify the files in the master branch! Just modify the files in the branch with your name.

Paper's Folder:
* The files in the folder branch with your name can be modified by you. In the 'Papers' folder, you can modify the papers you wish. The papers with initial names "SUBMITTED" and "PUBLISHED" are those that already were submitted or published. The papers without these names are those that still have to be submitted.

Notes Folder:
* This is the folder where ideas (typically theoretical ideas) can be exchanged between us. Again, you should not modify the folder in the master branch.
