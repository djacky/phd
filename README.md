Dr.(s) Karimi and Martino,
> This will be our repository to modify and share papers and notes for my PhD. I recommend that you highlight any changes that you make with your desired color (so that I can keep track of your changes and update the master branch accordingly). 

# WARNING: Never modify the files in the master branch! First click the branch with your name and then modify the files you wish in that branch.

Paper's Folder:
* The files in the folder branch with your name can be modified by you. In the 'Papers' folder, you can modify the papers you wish. The papers with initial names "SUBMITTED" and "PUBLISHED" are those that already were submitted or published. The papers without these names are those that still have to be submitted. You can actually modify the .TEX files directly on your branch. Simply click on the .TEX paper you wish to modify, and you will then see the raw latex code that you can modify. If you do this, don't forget to commit your changes. 
* If you prefer to first download the files to your computer and run the Latex code, simple download the files, do any modifications you wish, and then upload the modified files to the repository. 
* If you need to add references to the papers, please let me know the papers you would like to add, and I can then update the master branch with this new reference.

Notes Folder:
* This is the folder where ideas (typically theoretical ideas) can be exchanged between us. Again, you should not modify the folder in the master branch.

## Example:

* Login to the Github website
* Click on the "phd" repository
* Click on "Branch:" and switch to the branch with your name
* Change anything you wish within that branch
* After modifying files, make sure you press the "Commit" button to save the change
* That's it!

> To make the process easier for you, I would recommend that you download the Git software and use the interface. It requires about 1 hour to learn how to operate it, but it makes life much easier for you. If you prefer not to use the interface, then just manually adjust the files on the Git server (as stated in the above example).
